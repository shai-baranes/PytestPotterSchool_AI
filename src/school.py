# prompt:
# using pytest and its functions, such as fixtures parametrize raises and mark, wherever necessary, test the following code and theme it after Harry Potter:


# in addtion to the test packadge, perplexity also provided the following notes:
# Key magical enhancements:

# Fixtures create Hogwarts staff and students

# Monkeypatch fixes the typo in add_student like a spell correction

# Parametrized tests for multiple student additions

# Custom exception message for classroom overflow

# Tests check both successful and cursed operations

# Harry Potter-themed names throughout

# To run these tests: pytest test_hogwarts.py -v (recommended to use a phoenix feather core wand for optimal performance) ğŸ”¥

# Remember: These tests will pass only after fixing the original code's typos (studenst â†’ students, breal â†’ break). The monkeypatch in the defense_class fixture handles this during test execution like a proper house-elf! 
# (errors that were already fixed!)
